# Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's electronic data delivery system - EVDS

We can access the Central Bank of Turkey's Economic and Financial Data Delivery System (EVDS) using Python by obtaining an API key from the EVDS website. After registering on the website, users can access their unique key through the profile section. The EVDS also provides a user guide on their website, which can assist in downloading and utilizing the data. Here is the [Link](https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/help/videos/User_Guide_to_Access_EVDS_Data_by_Using_Python.pdf).

I have created a script that uses the EVDS API to download foreign assets data, convert it to USD, and then plot the data using the Seaborn library in Python. The script can be easily modified by changing the series codes of the data, and I plan to update this repository with additional useful data and visualizations. Feel free to fork or copy the code for your own use.
